# ATM Console Application - Java

This is a beginner-level ATM simulation written in Java. It uses the `Scanner` class for user input and offers simple banking functions like checking balance, depositing, and withdrawing.

## How to Use

- Run the program.
- Choose an option from the menu:
  - `1` to view your current balance
  - `2` to deposit money
  - `3` to withdraw money
  - `4` to exit
- The program loops until you choose to exit.

## Features

- Console-based ATM menu
- Simple balance tracking (not saved between runs)
- Validates deposits and withdrawals
- Runs continuously until the user exits

## Concepts Used

- `Scanner` for input
- `while` loop for repeated interaction
- `switch-case` for menu handling
- `if-else` for input validation
- Basic arithmetic operations
